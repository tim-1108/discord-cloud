/**
 * An abstract class used for communicating over a socket with packets in the format of `Packet`.
 * This class can be applied both inside a browser using the `WebSocket` API of the DOM and inside
 * Node using the `ws` package.
 *
 * Send a packet using `sendPacket`. Any packet that extends the `Packet` class can be sent
 * and will be serialized into a JSON object when sent.
 *
 * Using the method `sendPacketAndReply`, the callee may optionally await a Promise that can
 * return a reply packet of, and only of, the supplied class. If the set or default timeout
 * is exceeded and nothing is received, that Promise will resolve with `null` instead of
 * an instance of `replyClass`.
 *
 * If the implementer of this class has received a packet over the network and may wish to
 * send a reply to it, call `replyToPacket` with the original received packet and the packet
 * to be answered with.
 *
 * Whenever incoming packets are handled inside the `handleSocketMessage` method, which every
 * subclass has to implement, make sure to call `resolveReplies`, to check if the packet that
 * has just been received might have been meant as a reply to something else. This then gets
 * handled and should eliminate all reasons to process this packet further (as a Promise at
 * another location will have been resolved with that incoming packet).
 *
 * It is important to call `initialize` to load all listeners for the socket
 * (optimally inside the constructor). This methods return value indicates success
 * in opening the socket connection.
